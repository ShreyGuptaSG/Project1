    "TASK 1\n",
    "FORECASTING PROBLEM:\n",
    "The purpose of this competition is to forecast used car selling prices based on the attributes of cars sold. The major problem with this dataset is the existence of redundant and imbalanced data which should be decreased. Another issue is the presence of a few outliers which can significantly affect the prediction (leading to underestimated or overestimated prices). These outloers could be deleted as these are not essential in predicting the used car sale prices. Therefore, in order to obtain the best results, cleaning the dataset before analysing is cruicial. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TYPES OF VARIABLES/FEATURES: \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, two types of variables are possible within a dataset i.e., Categorical variables and Numerical variables. Categorical variables classify people into one of several categories based on their category or label values. There is only one category for each observation, and the categories are mutually exclusive. Whereas Numerical variables or quantitative variables indicate a measurement. For example, in our train dataset body_type, exterior_color, among others, represent categorical variables while variables like highway_fuel_economy, dealer_zip, among others represent numerical variables. The training dataset has 39 features/variables where _ are categorical while __ are numerical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "DATA SUMMARY AND MAIN DATA CHARACTERSTICS:\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning algorithm is built on the train data. The algorithm is fed input data by the data analyst, which correlates to an intended output. After developing the model, the testing the data confirms that it can make accurate predictions. The training dataset provided contains 3500 rows and 39 columns/ variables. The test dataset provided contains 1500 observations and 38 variables/columns. The target variable is the used car sale price. The dataset also highlights numerical features like back_legroom, front_legroom, height, length, among others. One of the first and most crucial tasks in every machine learning activity is feature selection. In the context of a dataset, a feature simply refers to a column. Not every column (feature) in the dataset will necessarily have an effect on the output variable. If we include these non-essential characteristics in the model, it will affect the predictions. As a result, feature selection becomes necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "EVALUATION CRITERIA:\n",
    "The machine learning regression model that we are using is Gradient boosting regression model. Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression, classification, and other problems that generates a prediction model from an ensemble of weak prediction models, most commonly decision trees. GB constructs an additive model in a stage-by-stage manner, allowing for the optimization of any differentiable loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "MISSING VALUES:\n",
    "There are many null and blank values. For example, there are null values for front leg room and back leg room. We tackled this situation by getting mode out of categorical values and mean out of numerical values.\n"
